                        <a href='https://www.soft2d.tech/'>Soft2D</a> is a 2D multi-material continuum physics engine designed for real-time applications. 
                        With soft2d, users can simulate various materials such as fluids, sand, snow, and elastic bodies within their applications. Soft2D runs on GPU, and currently supports Vulkan and Metal backends.
                        For user convenience, we offer a comprehensive suite of easy-to-use interfaces in C language. Please see the <a href='https://docs.soft2d.tech/'>user documentation</a> for more details. 
                        We also provide a free-to-access unity plugin - <a href='https://github.com/taichi-dev/soft2d-for-unity'>Soft2D for Unity</a>, which allows users to build simulation scenes in a low-code way.

                        Unlike other matrix-free methods (such as PCG), which avoid the explicit construction of stiffness matrices, we provide a full derivation for a 2D semi-implicit method and present the explicit form of the stiffness matrix.

                    <p>
                        This project aims to develop a high-performance PBD (position-based dynamics) physics engine, which is similar to Houdini Vellum. The engine supports a series of materials' simulation: rigid body, soft body, fluid, cloth, granular material, etc. 
                        We achieve <a href='https://twitter.com/TaichiGraphics/status/1537193238632599552'>a 60 FPS's 240k particles fluid simulation</a>, and the simulation can be extended to <a href='https://twitter.com/taichi_lang/status/1593148740105568256'>a large-scale scene</a> (there are 20 million particles in the picture on the right side).
                        To obtain a high-quality fluid surface, we implement a surface reconstruction algorithm based on dual contouring.
                        In this project, we also use a CCD (Continuous collision detection) algorithm to tackle the tricky collision problem.

                        This plugin simulates SPH (smoothed-particle hydrodynamics) linear elasticity deformable objects and fluids in the UE (Unreal Engine) game engine. 
                        We implement several linear algebra algorithms in (high-level shader language) HLSL, for example, a HLSL version's 3x3 SVD algorithm.
                        To our knowledge, we are the first ones who implement these algorithms in HLSL.
                        The major reference for this project is the SPH-related papers mentioned in Jan Bender's SPH Eurographics course.

                        This plugin is optimized specifically for mobile devices and is able to run at 2ms/frame performance on a mid-range mobile phone.

                    <p>
                        This project achieves a BRDF model renderer based on path tracing (I am considering expanding this project to the BSSRDF model in the future).
                        In Monte Carlo integration, uniform sampling is used, and direct/indirect light sources are sampled separately to improve rendering quality.
                        Moreover, a Russian Roulette scheme is used when casting rays recursively.
                        In this project, a BVH (bounding volume hierarchy) data structure is used to accelerate querying ray-triangle intersection.
                        This project is inspired by the course <a href='https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/teaching/games101.html'> GAMES 101</a>.

                        This project aims to explore the possibility of achieving real-time interactive fluid simulations in desktop and mobile games.
                        Two popular Lagrangian methods, SPH (Smooth Particles Hydrodynamics) and PBF (Position Based Fluids), are achieved on both PC and cell phones, and their performance is compared.
                        For free-surface rendering, two rendering methods are implemented and compared: Marching Cubes and SSFR (Screen Space Fluid Rendering). 
                        This project is written by Unity compute shader and fully runs on GPU.
